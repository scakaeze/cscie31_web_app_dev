# project-1-Harvard-DCE-CSCIE31
This is the readme.md for the introductory project in CSCI E31.  You will be cloning this project
locally in your own git repository, adding some Javsacsript code to it, and then pushing
it back to this *Github Classroom* repo.

You'll also clone it to your Digital Ocean server where it can be accessed over the Web.

See the course-setup folder in this repo, and the course Canvas site (Assigments, and Modules for Weeks 1 and 2) for details.   

For writing and modifying these .md files, search the Web for documentation on the *Markdown* format. 

This is my welcome project for CSCI E31
