# CSCI-E31 Course Description

This course provides an introduction to web application development by way of JavaScript and the node.js environment. Students learn the basics of server-side web development using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular/Angular 2, node.js). Using the MEAN stack, the course introduces students to models of software development that can apply to any web development environment, including the application server (node.js), Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks using Express.js, front-end frameworks (Angular), and databases (MongoDB). The course includes setting up a node.js environment, building web APIs and full-stack JavaScript applications using the MEAN stack, and following good application development practices. Experience with server-side application development is not required, though knowledge of client-side web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) is important.
